                <dd>Refrigerate can of coconut milk, 8 hours or overnight.
                    Open can of coconut milk, taking care not to shake it. Scoop coconut cream solids into a
                    mixing
                    bowl. Reserve remaining liquid for another use.
                    Beat coconut cream and brown sugar using electric mixer with chilled beaters on medium speed; turn
                    to high
                    speed.
                    Beat until stiff peaks form, 7 to 8 minutes. Break
                    gingerbread
                    cookies into small pieces, cut mandarins into smaller pieces. Add the gingerbread cookies,
                    mandarins and raspberries to coconut cream, mix and leave for gingerbread to soak up the
                    cream
                    and become softer. Serve into a glass with some grated dark chocolate and berries on top!

        <div class="question-container">
            <div class="question">What is a vegan?</div>
            <div class="answer">Vegans avoid eating all foods of animal origin: meat, fish, dairy products, eggs, and
                honey.
                Veganism was originally defined purely as a dietary choice, but many vegans extend this ethic to
                shun animal testing and ingredients from all things they consume or wear, including clothing,
                shoes, personal care items, cosmetics, and medicine.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="question-container">
            <div class="question">Why do people become vegan?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <ul>
                <li>Prevention of Animal Suffering</li>
                    Most farm animals are raised on factory farms and experience appalling cruelties throughout
                    their lives. Animal slaughter is invariably gory and disturbing to witness, and often the
                    animals are clearly frightened and seem to know their death is imminent.

                <li>Health Benefits</li>
                    A vegan diet can eliminate many of your diet's most unhealthful foods, replacing them with
                    delicious, nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, and nuts.

                <li>Environmental Advantages</li>
                    Given the staggering amounts of methane produced by livestock, a vegan diet may offer the
                    easiest and most effective way to reduce our contribution to climate change. Vegan diets can
                    also dramatically reduce land devoted to crops and to pasture, since growing food for farmed
                    animals is extraordinarily wasteful compared to growing crops directly for people.
                </ul>

        <div class="question-container">
            <div class="question">How hard is it really to become vegan?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Nearly every single vegan you ask will tell you the transition was much easier than they
                expected. While becoming vegan may sound difficult right now, you'll no doubt be shocked by how
                easy this is.
